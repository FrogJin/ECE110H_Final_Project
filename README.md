This is the Final product after 1 month of work. <br />
There are one [Speaker - PCB Mount](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11089), four [Laser Module - Green](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9906) and four [Light to Frequency Converter - TSL235R](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9768) attached at the front of the guitar. Each laser beam land exactly at the center of one converter. <br />
Initially, the laser shot on the converter, the converter will read a frequency. When a finger block the laser, the converter will read a different frequency for a very short period of time, which triggers the corresponding sound.
